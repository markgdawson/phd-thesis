general-purpose method (as opposed to specialised) - unstuctured mesh represents geometry
approximate any geom
curvilinear elements -> elements with curved faces (Hesthaven reference?)
however "highest computational efficiency is achieved for planar-faced elements" - really!??
arbitrary order shape functions
FDTD is bound to 2nd order accuracy when dealing with material interfaces [Taflov]
Method of lines
    discretisation in space i.e. PDE spatial derivatices ---> matrix operators
    no discretisation in space
    =implies=> loads of freq and time domain options available [niegemann reference]

TD => "SHORT TD PULSES" give a broadband freq response in a single run
final time important => easy parallelisation
    high-order planar faces reference [ nodal high-order methods on unstructured grids - J S Hesthaven ]
    for high-order curvilinear faces reference [ Warbunton...!? ]

-----

** TESSELATION OF DOMAIN **
computation domain omega divided into "K non-overlapping body conforming simplices D^i" where i is the index i \in { 1,...,K }
Ref 21 (i.e. HEsthaven + Warbunton = Nodal High-Order methods on unstructured ....) ==> simplices can be curvilinear - but assume planar face

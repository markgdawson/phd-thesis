abstract = {We investigate a nanolaser structure with a gold nanowire that supports long-range surface plasmon polaritons (LR-SPPs). A high refractive index semiconductor gain medium surrounding the nanowire allows the LR-SPPs to be well bound to the nanowire even for a small radius of ∼15  nm with sufficiently small attenuation. An outermost gold shield with a radius of 400~nm is introduced to prohibit the mode from radiating out to free space when the modal cutoff-like feedback structure is used to confine the propagating mode longitudinally. Numerical simulations for an optimized structure show that the quality factor and lasing threshold gain of the resonant mode at room temperature are 158 and 1590  cm{\textminus}1, respectively. We also find that the nanolaser supports another type of plasmonic resonant mode with localized surface plasmons on the nanowire with the outermost gold shield, which possesses a quality factor of 220 and a threshold gain of 950  cm{\textminus}1. These gain coefficients can be obtained in bulk semiconductors.},

abstract = {Applications of the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method for numerical modeling of electromagnetic wave interactions with structures are reviewed, concentrating on scattering and radar cross section (RCS). A number of two- and three-dimensional examples of FD-TD modeling of scattering and penetration are provided. The objects modeled range in nature from simple geometric shapes to extremely complex aerospace and biological systems. Rigorous analytical or experimental validations are provided for the canonical shapes, and it is shown that FD-TD predictive data for near fields and RCS are in excellent agreement with the benchmark data. It is concluded that, with continuing advances in FD-TD modeling theory for target features relevant to the RCS problem, and with continuing advances in vector and concurrent supercomputer technology, it is likely that FD-TD numerical modeling will occupy an important place in RCS technology in the 1990s and beyond View full abstract},

abstract = {This paper presents a newly developed high-order discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method for solving Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media with UPML boundary treatment. A unified formulation is derived for linear dispersive media of Debye type and the artificial material in the UPML regions with the help of auxiliary differential equations. The DGTD employs finite-element-type meshes, and uses piecewise high-order polynomials for spatial discretization and Runge-Kutta method for time integrations. Arbitrary high-order accuracy can be obtained for scattering of various objects in dispersive media. After validating the numerical convergence of the DGTD method together with the second-order Yee's scheme, we apply this new method to the ground-penetrating radar for the detection of buried objects in a lossy half space.

abstract = {A weakness of the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method is that dispersion of the dielectric properties of the scattering/absorbing body is often ignored and frequency-independent properties are generally taken. While this is not a disadvantage for CW or narrowband irradiation, the results thus obtained may be highly erroneous for short pulses where ultrawide bandwidths are involved. In some recent publications, procedures based on a convolution integral describing D(t) in terms of E(t) are given for media for which the complex permittivity ∈*($\omega$) may be described by a single-order Debye relaxation equation or a modified version thereof. Procedures are, however, needed for general dispersive media for which ∈*($\omega$) and $\mu$*($\omega$) may be expressible in terms of rational functions, or for human tissues for which multiterm Debye relaxation equations must generally be used. The authors describe a new differential equation approach, which can be used for general dispersive media. In this method D(t) in terms of E(t) by means of a differential equation involving E, and their time derivatives. The method is illustrated for several examples View full abstract},

abstract = {Optical micro-cavities and resonators have been identified as key building blocks for many photonic components and systems. However, once the canonical configurations amenable to mathematical analysis have been investigated, it is necessary to address more geometrically complex structures which can only be approached with numerical techniques. However, such structures present many challenges for the simulations, especially when using broadband time domain approaches, and this is the topic that will be discussed in this paper.

From the polarization-resolved photo-luminescence measurements, we observed the resonance of GaN bandedge emission with the cavity modes to be transverse magnetic-polarization active and characterized with a quality factor as high as ∼1000 in a GaN cavity of 0.75 {\textmu} m side length. Using a finite difference time domain technique, we showed that these observations can be ascribed to the material{\textquoteright}s dispersion effects. The latter can modify the cavity phase-matching condition, reduce the spectral bandwidth of the corresponding resonant modes and enhance the cavity quality factor by a factor more than three.},

However, unlike Berenger's technique, the uniaxial PML absorbing medium presented in this paper is based on a Maxwellian formulation.

abstract = {The traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) formulation is extended to include a discrete time-domain convolution, which is efficiently evaluated using recursion. The accuracy of the extension is demonstrated by computing the reflection coefficient at an air-water interface over a wide frequency band including the effects of the frequency-dependent permittivity of water. Extension to frequency-dependent permeability and to three dimensions is straightforward. The frequency dependent FDTD formulation allows computation of electromagnetic interaction with virtually any material and geometry (subject only to computer resource limitations) with pulse excitation. Materials that are highly dispersive, such as snow, ice, plasma, and radar-absorbing material, can be considered efficiently by using this formulation. View full abstract},

abstract = {We proposed a straightforward and highly efficient DGTD implementation of the Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layer (UPML). Discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) is imposed on both the UPML Maxwell's curl equations and the auxiliary differential equations (ADE). By recording the intermediate results in the updated processes of E-fields and H-fields, the computation time for auxiliary variables in ADE can be reduced greatly within each time step. Moreover, the auxiliary variables and Riemann flux on each elemental interface are treated dependently here, using which, an excellent stable PML scheme can be obtained. Some examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this UPML, and the proposed method behaves much more stable than the well-posed PML, which is commonly used as PML absorber in DGTD algorithm currently.

A unified formulation is derived for linear dispersive media of Debye type and the artificial material in the UPML regions with the help of auxiliary differential equations. The DGTD employs finite-element-type meshes, and uses piecewise high-order polynomials for spatial discretization and Runge-Kutta method for time integrations. Arbitrary high-order accuracy can be obtained for scattering of various objects in dispersive media. After validating the numerical convergence of the DGTD method together with the second-order Yee's scheme, we apply this new method to the ground-penetrating radar for the detection of buried objects in a lossy half space.

abstract = {A two-dimensional Yee's mesh with reduced grid size is proposed for the full-wave analysis of arbitrarily shaped guided wave structures. By introducing a phase shift beta Delta h along the z-direction (propagation direction), it is possible to calculate the propagation constant, of hybrid modes by using only a two-dimensional mesh. This step not only allows the frequency selective application of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, as desired in many design problems, but it also reduces the memory space and CPU time of the full-wave FDTD significantly. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift, the space grid in the propagation direction is reduced to half its normal size.<<ETX>>},

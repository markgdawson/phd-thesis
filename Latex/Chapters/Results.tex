In this chapter we validate our results using a 2-dimensional rectangular free space cavity ($\epsilon=\mu=1$). For such a cavity the resonant frequencies are discrete due to confinement of the wave and can be shown [***ref***] to be given by the expression

$$
f_nm = ...
$$

where $n$ and $m$ are the mode numbers.

The cavity considered is of unit length by height 0.5 %% *** check this
and surrounded by a PEC boundary.

We consider that the cavity is divided using a uniform mesh of quadrilateral elements

%% NOTE::: HAVE I TRIED THIS WITH TRIANGLES



Parallel: benchmark times for communication and calculation for different meshes + compare to overall performance plots should appear somewhere - should appear somewhere in results.

Lots of motivation - this needs to be like a sales pitch to industry/goverment on why this research is important.
Refer to specific examples of cavities - this includes maybe acoustic cavities and EM ones and a lot of examples of lasers
Talk the need to make things SMALLER
AVOID WAFFLE - always refer to specific examples from literature - like a literature review.
What nanolasers (and cavities) have been simulated or built recently
Look for recent SPECIAL ISSUES or BOOKS on maybe resonance, cavities, nanolasers, EM cavities etc etc etc - look at the references.
ANYONE should be able to read this with NO expertise

\begin{itemize}
	\item what is the problem (resonant frequencies in a cavity)
	\item what is a cavity? where are they used? why are they relevant? - laser design
	\item industrial relevance - why is there need for research (nano/smaller)
  \item what are the quantities of interest in a cavity (res freq/QF/mode shapes)
\end{itemize}

#+TODO: TODO(t) RUN(r) RUNNING(r) POSTPROCESS(p) FIGURE(f) PUT(p) | DONE(d)

* EXTRACTION PRIORITY
** 2D FS ...? - just signals to generate the "all the spectra" plot
** 2D Dispersive
*** selected spectrum + signal example
*** comparative non-dispersive signal/spectrum.
*** get data:
**** material parameters
**** T
**** initial condition
** 2D Notched...
** 3D timings extraction
* Have I downloaded most recent timing comparison?
* WAITING ON EXTRACTION
* 2D Free Space Cavity (some runs)
** check: 8x16 p1, 2x4 p1/p2
** do all the initial spectrum comparisons (again)
*** WITH THE SAME final time
*** used dt=0.025, NTS=2^22, Tfin approx 104858 (power 2)
*** put dt for each simulation in text (mention normalised)
**** use a normalised dt. e.g. multiply by common factor etc? Exactly the same signal
** use p=2,16x8 AND p=3,4x8 for all of these (should be easy)
*** TODO effects of using a different IC
***** gaussian at a point
***** gaussian in time
***** near/far monitor points
*** PUT plot showing effect on peak of running for longer...
*** TODO something to do with multiple monitor points?
*** TODO something to do eventual noise in signal
***** either...take those plots with a moving spectrum window
***** or...take the plots where the ORIGINAL signal degrades...
***** can I SEE this in the spectrum...?
*** PUT importance of using start of the signal
**** tried with no discard and 10,000 discard
**** tried for 30 different discard times,
     equally spaced on a log scale between 0 and 10000, for frequency 1
***** the maximum difference observed was 10^13.5
**** we conclude the the effect of the wave before reaching steady state is negligable for long signals (what about short signals?)
*** PUT Comment on error only
**** whilst error has little effect...noise at high period causes dramatic attenutation of higher frequencies....errors!
*** FIGURE aliasing effects - PROBLEM -> I think I didn't do this with the same final time as everything else...!??
**** dt = 0.025
**** dt = 0.2
**** dt = 0.4
*** TODO single peak with different amounts of zero padding
**** with Blackman filter (only? Rect too?)
**** show single peak (same signal) with various amounts of zero padding
**** show effect of zero padding on CONVERGENCE (i.e. conv plot with various degrees of zero padding).
**** T=10000 -> with various degrees of zero padding....!
**** only plot fundamental frequency
**** something about QFFT convergence?
**** mention QFFT (as an alternative) with an example -> show an example...mention issues with lower errors...
*** show convergence with different amount of zero padding....!! nice plot....!
*** POSTPROCESS time length - same zero padding on all (mention in text)
**** no "special plotting"
***** T=10
***** T=100
***** T=1000
***** T=10000
***** T=MAX, to check that a bigger time has no effect...
*** POSTPROCESS Filter functions, with T=10000 (check that this is enough)
**** DO THIS WITH A SINGLE PEAK....(effect will be the same for whole spectrum)
**** Blackman
**** Blackman-Harries
**** Gaussian
**** Rectangular
*** POSTPROCESS Convergence in time for 10 frequencies, up to T=10000 (i.e. log10(4)), consistent zero padding
*** Also get convergence plots with and without zero padding d with/without QFFT...?
* 3D Cube
** plot SPECTRA (using the same T as previously)
** 3D Cube - add points for coarse meshes
*** add even if I can't see the peak)
* PP - less intense
** dispersive
*** NEED EXTRACTION dispersive spectrum -> do again WITHOUT units, but put units in the text
* TIMING: uniform-p
** RUNS: single-p STRONG scaling - do again for HEX as well as TET
*** do the basic timings again on HPC wales
**** build based on ACME presentation + either p=6 or p=8
*** put in the text the number of time steps and the averages etc..
*** Just redo these timing plots on blueice....
*** Include some bar chart of total communication->computation
** RUNS: single-p weak scaling - do for HEX as well as TET
*** use my HEX and TET meshes, increase the problem size, and increase the processors as well
* Adaptive p L2 norm: extra points for L2 norm mixed p
*** point out that I'm using the relative L2 norm error...
*** L2 required for p=2 and p=3...that is all
* CAVITIES WITH SMALL FEATURES..
** Loads of plots to get here
** but what else can I get...?
** also need to COMPARE TO PAPER...
* PHOTONIC CRYTALS...RUN ME...! Better and corresponding
* EXTRA PLOTS (NO RUNS)
** 3D non-uniform cube
*** show the mesh + partition - for weighted, unweighted and computed weights
** Rectangular dispersive cavity
*** show solution (E_1 and H_3) in a coarse mesh with high p
*** show the error distribution for both
*** if I've got BOTH TE AND TM - do the amplitude instead...?
* EDITING PLOTS
** 2D_FreeSpaceCavity/Conv/U[2]/F1_TE - remove lowest point
** Change errors etc on the circle
** Dispersive signals in time - remove units of time, mention in the text instead
** 3D non-uniform cube
*** first figure(red):
**** x axis should contain 0 and nProcs
**** show distribution of element p (to show that it correpsponds)
**** maybe: show two mini subfigures next to it with the same scaling as the unweighted (so I can see the speed difference)
*** second figure(yellow, (c) ):
**** x axis should contain 0 and nProcs
**** here I present the operation count, use the paaper, add some figures adapted from the paper
**** In the text write and discuss the minimum of these figures. 0.7 meaning a maximum of 30% difference of CPU times in different processors.
*** third figure(blue):
**** x axis should contain 0 and nProcs
**** next you show that you can "optimise" by timing a simulaiton in your current system
**** If I time I get 0.8 (meaning a maximum of 20% difffernece of CPU times in different processors).
*** CONCLUSION: you can imrpoce, but it isn't massive and requires an initial timing.
*** need to make sure I can/have somehow shown the actual gain in CPU time

*** OPERATION COUNT:
**** get timings, and normalise with respect to the smallest, so I'm showing how much the timed p=8 compares to the untimed p=8

Figures are obtained by running the hConvergence script with two parameters - combined = true, and a specific component for the combined plot and with combined = false and all components for all plots.

original scripts and data can be obtained on
/Volumes/HardDrive/Users/mark/Research/2D_Circle/convergencePlots
on my laptop
